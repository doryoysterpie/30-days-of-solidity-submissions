// SubscriptionStorageLayout defines the storage layout for a subscription management system.
// This contract is intended to be used as the storage layer for a proxy pattern, where the logic contract can be upgraded without changing the storage layout. It includes:
// - logicContract: Address of the current logic contract that implements the subscription management functionality.
// - owner: Address of the contract owner who can manage subscription plans and upgrade the logic contract.
// - Subscription struct: Contains details about a user's subscription, including the plan ID, expiry timestamp, and paused status.
// - subscriptions mapping: Maps user addresses to their subscription details.
// - planPrices mapping: Maps plan IDs to their respective prices.
// - planDurations mapping: Maps plan IDs to their respective durations in seconds.
